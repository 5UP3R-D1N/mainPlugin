## This is the plugin for the Online Discord Community server

### Instructions:

* Run `./gradlew jar` in the console
* Put the output file (./build/libs/newPlugin.jar) in the /config/mods folder.
* Create a settings.json file in the same location as the plugin file.
* Use the same format as the example in the exampleSettings.json file.
* If you don't have a postgreSQL server some functions might not work.
* Now run the `server-release.jar` file (you have to run this file, because it's a special version of the server to work with the postgreSQL server)
